# CHALLENGE NOTES

-   Add state and setState logic into the SearchBar component (isOpen)
    -   Add conditional rendering so the input field either displays or doesn't based on isOpen === true
-   Add state and setState logic into the CardBack component (isFav)
    -   Add logic so the solid/hollow heart swap when you click on them (the icons are commented out in the file)

## EXTENSION

-   Stop the card from flipping when you click on the heart (will require troubleshooting - research how to stop event propagation)
