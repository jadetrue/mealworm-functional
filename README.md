# CHALLENGE NOTES

## React sandbox repo

Add the capability for a user to sign in and sing out with google to your react sandbox repo

- You do not have to mimic the conditional rendering in MealWorm (where either the book or google icon are shown)
- As long as you can see the user data in your console/react devtools that is okay
- Add the logic to sing out after (This is not something we covered in the code along and will require you to read the firebase docs)

### Extension

GET CREATIVE!

- See what information is returned in the user object from firebase after login
- Can any of this be made useful to the user?
